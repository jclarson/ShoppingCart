# Name

Shopping Cart

# Description

This is a JavaScript React program with a Strapi database backend that simulates a shopping cart.

# Installation

Requires the index.html, cart.jsx files to be in the same directory.  For proper re-stocking functionality, you will also need an API source that contains products that have the attributes "name", "country", "cost", and "instock".

# Usage

Load the HTML file in a browser to see the products.  Click the "Add to Cart" button next to an item to add it to the cart.
Expand an item in the cart and click the opened accordion item to delete it from the cart.
Enter the API source and click the "Restock" button to add products from the API to the Products list.
